This project implements the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) reinforcement learning algorithm to solve a classic 10-armed bandit problem using real ad-click-through data. Across 10,000 rounds (representing 10,000 users), the algorithm evaluates 10 different ads and learns which ad yields the highest reward. UCB balances exploration of less-tested ads with exploitation of high-reward ads by computing an optimistic score for each arm. The results show that Ad 4 was selected the most—over six thousand times—indicating it has the highest expected reward among all ads. This repository demonstrates how UCB identifies the best-performing option with minimal regret, making it useful for applications like online advertising, recommendation systems, and A/B testing.
